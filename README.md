# HI-SEAS
NASA HI-SEAS missions act as a testbed and training ground for humans as we develop the capability to explore Mars. A recent NASA Space Apps Challenge hackathon asked participants to use data collected from the HI-SEAS site to predict solar radiation given a set of measurable meteorological conditions. Knowing when conditions are most favorable for incident solar radiation is crucial for deciding when and where to deploy solar energy harvesting equipment, especially for colonists or astronauts on the surface of Mars.
